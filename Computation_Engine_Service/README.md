# Computation Engine Service

## Description

The Computation Engine Service is tasked with the execution of computational tasks based on the problem types submitted by users. It utilizes various algorithms and computational strategies to efficiently solve problems and return results.

## Features

- **Problem Execution**: Executes computational problems using designated algorithms.
- **Performance Optimization**: Incorporates performance enhancements and algorithm optimizations for various problem types.
- **Result Management**: Manages and stores results, providing asynchronous access to completed computations.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language for algorithm implementation.
- **Celery with RabbitMQ**: For managing asynchronous task processing.
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Used for mathematical computations.
- **Docker**: Containerization of the computation environment for consistency across different setups.
